1 .Kruskal algorithm (MST) using disjoint set union(DSU)

2. Tropological Sort using this i solved oredring task (uva -10305)

3. PrimsAlgorithm MinimumSpanning Tree raw MST 
4. Substring hash file to count number of occurence of string in another 
string using hash function . Sample problem is lightoj : 1255 - Substring Frequency

5. SQRTdecompose is to find count of number A[i] l<=i<=r and A[i]>=c where c is a given number 

6. Segment tree lazyPropagration is added to find sum between [l,r] and update between [l,r] with log(n) time
7. MOs algorithm complexity O( (N+M) * sqrt N )
8. Max flow contains basic maxflow implementation
